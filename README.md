# Genomic_Sequence_Analysis

In this project we are using **K-Means** and **PCA** to help figure out that DNA is composed of 3-letter words.

It is an extended application of the paper written by Alexander N. Gorban and Andrei Y. Zinovyev (PCA and K-Means Decipher Genome) where the project was performed using Matlab.

Here we are proposing an extension of this project using Python.

This project is an application of making sense of unstructured data using unsupervised learning techniques.
